/**
 * An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was

 * the target location of an active webhook.
 *
 * The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
 * subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
 * modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events
 * are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
 * consumers should make sure to handle this case.
 *
 * The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
 * that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
 * example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
 * contained within the project.
 *
 * **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
 * `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
 * `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
 * itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
 * within the resource's fields have been modified.
 *
 * For instance, consider these scenarios:
 *
 *
 * * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
 * `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
 * `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.
 *
 *
 * * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
 * `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
 * `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
 * be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
 *
 *
 * * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
 * be `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
 * `Event.change.action` will be `added`, and `added_value` will be
 * an object with the user's `id` and `type`.

     * @description Retrieve the audit log events that have been captured in your domain. This endpoint will return a list of [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects, sorted by creation time in ascending order. Note that the Audit Log API captures events from October 8th, 2021 and later. Queries for events before this date will not return results. There are a number of query parameters (below) that can be used to filter the set of [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects that are returned in the response. Any combination of query parameters is valid. When no filters are provided, all of the events that have been captured in your domain will match. The list of events will always be [paginated](/docs/pagination). The default limit is 1000 events. The next set of events can be retrieved using the `offset` from the previous response. If there are no events that match the provided filters in your domain, the endpoint will return `null` for the `next_page` field. Querying again with the same filters may return new events if they were captured after the last request. Once a response includes a `next_page` with an `offset`, subsequent requests can be made with the latest `offset` to poll for new events that match the provided filters. *Note: If the filters you provided match events in your domain and `next_page` is present in the response, we will continue to send `next_page` on subsequent requests even when there are no more events that match the filters. This was put in place so that you can implement an audit log stream that will return future events that match these filters. If you are not interested in future events that match the filters you have defined, you can rely on checking empty `data` response for the end of current events that match your filters.* When no `offset` is provided, the response will begin with the oldest events that match the provided filters. It is important to note that [AuditLogEvent](/reference/audit-log-api) objects will be permanently deleted from our systems after 90 days. If you wish to keep a permanent record of these events, we recommend using a SIEM tool to ingest and store these logs.

    /**
     * @description To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app's advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need. #### Premium access Like the Asana web product's advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true: - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a `402 Payment Required` error. #### Pagination Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the `limit` query parameter. #### Eventual consistency Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product. #### Rate limits You may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits). #### Custom field parameters | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID | | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number | For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be `custom_fields.12345.is_set=true`. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: `custom_fields.12345.value=67890`. **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field *Note: If you specify `projects.any` and `sections.any`, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you're looking for only tasks in a section, omit the `projects.any` from the request.*

This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results. The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and cannot be paginated. Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what data is included in a response. Resources with type `user` are returned in order of most contacted to least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages, etc. Resources with type `project` are returned in order of recency. This is determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and completes tasks in the project. Resources with type `task` are returned with priority placed on tasks the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks. Resources with type `project_template` are returned with priority placed on favorited project templates. Leaving the `query` string empty or omitted will give you results, still following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or projects that are relevant for the requesting user's api token.

     * @description Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST request initiates the creation similar to creating any other resource. Next, in the middle of this request comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will send a test POST to the target with an `X-Hook-Secret` header. The target must respond with a `200 OK` or `204 No Content` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret` header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected. We strongly recommend storing this secret to be used to verify future webhook event signatures. The POST request to create the webhook will then return with the status of the request. If you do not acknowledge the webhook’s confirmation handshake it will fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight (in other words, have a server that can handle requests asynchronously). Invalid hostnames like localhost will recieve a 403 Forbidden status code. ``` # Request curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <personal_access_token>" \ -X POST https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/webhooks \ -d "resource=8675309" \ -d "target=https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654" ``` ``` # Handshake sent to https://example.com/ POST /receive-webhook/7654 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 ``` ``` # Handshake response sent by example.com HTTP/1.1 200 X-Hook-Secret: b537207f20cbfa02357cf448134da559e8bd39d61597dcd5631b8012eae53e81 ``` ``` # Response HTTP/1.1 201 { "data": { "gid": "43214", "resource": { "gid": "8675309", "name": "Bugs" }, "target": "https://example.com/receive-webhook/7654", "active": false, "last_success_at": null, "last_failure_at": null, "last_failure_content": null } } ```
