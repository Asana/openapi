        Create a new project in a workspace or team.

        Every project is required to be created in a specific workspace or
        organization, and this cannot be changed once set. Note that you can use
        the `workspace` parameter regardless of whether or not it is an
        organization.

        A personal access token allows access to the api for the user who
        created it. This should be kept a secret and be treated like a
        password.

        We require that applications designed to access the Asana API on behalf
        of multiple users implement OAuth 2.0.
        Asana supports the Authorization Code Grant flow.
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://app.asana.com/-/oauth_authorize

              Provides access to all endpoints documented in our API reference.
              If no scopes are requested, this scope is assumed by default.
            openid: >-
              Provides access to OpenID Connect ID tokens and the OpenID Connect
              user info endpoint.
            email: >-
              Provides access to the user’s email through the OpenID Connect
              user info endpoint.
            profile: >-
              Provides access to the user’s name and profile photo through the
              OpenID Connect user info endpoint.

      A project represents a prioritized list of tasks in Asana or a board
      with columns of tasks represented as cards. A project exists in a single
      workspace or organization and is accessible to a subset of users in that
      workspace or organization, depending on its permissions.


      Projects in organizations are shared with a single team. Currently, the team
      of a project cannot be changed via the API. Non-organization
      workspaces do not have teams and so you should not specify the team of
      project in a regular workspace.


      Followers of a project are a subset of the members of that project.
      Followers of a project will receive all updates including tasks
      created, added and removed from that project. Members of the project
      have access to and will receive status updates of the project. Adding
      followers to a project will add them as members if they are not
      already, removing followers from a project will not affect membership.


      **Note:** You can use certain project endpoints to operate on
      [user task lists](/reference/user-task-lists) ([My Tasks](https://asana.com/guide/help/fundamentals/my-tasks))
      by substituting the `{project_gid}` with the `{user_task_list_gid}`. For example, you can perform
      operations on the custom fields of a user task list by using the following
      projects endpoints: [Add a custom field to a project](/reference/addcustomfieldsettingforproject),
      [Remove a custom field from a project](/reference/removecustomfieldsettingforproject) and
      [Get a project's custom fields](/reference/getcustomfieldsettingsforproject)
